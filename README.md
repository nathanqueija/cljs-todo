# Canvas explorations

A simple Todo App buit with ClojureScript, Reagent and Reframe. 


## Getting started

- Install dependencies

I use Yarn, but you can follow the same instructions using NPM.

```
yarn install
```
- Build and run the project in development mode
```
yarn dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

If you prefer to run the app on a different port you can change it the `shadow-cljs.edn` file.
